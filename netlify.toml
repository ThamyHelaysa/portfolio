# Redirects and headers are GLOBAL for all builds â€“ they do not get scoped to
# contexts no matter where you define them in the file.
# For context-specific rules, use _headers or _redirects files, which are

  # By default, redirects won't be applied if there's a file with the same
  # path as the one defined in the `from` property. Setting `force` to `true`
  # will make the redirect rule take precedence over any existing files.

  # Redirect from /old-path?id=123 to /new-path. Each combination of query
  # params needs to be defined in a separate [[redirects]] block.
