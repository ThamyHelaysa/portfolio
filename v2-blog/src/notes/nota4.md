I hated this years add from coca-cola. The most important (marketing-wise) time of the year for most of the people was seeing what beautifully crafted ad they would put out there. And they gave us AI slop.
Hate it, BUT at the end of the tunnel there is Bradesco, with their most emotional ad I ever see it.
And you need it too:

make our 5min ad watch at least less miserable than our other (364 days a year) please
i didnt want to cry, but i did
white cgi bears? are you out of your mind? these things eat human beeings
christmas truck? sure i see them EVEN IN MY SMALL ASS BRONZILIAN CITY, DID YOU NOT HAVE ANY TO AT LEAST RECORD????
get me wanting to grab a zero coke please or im gonna switch pepsi (kidding)
i dont really know if my mom would think this ad is emotional or if its nostalgic
the point is coca cola didnt make me remember her, but maccoulin kaulkin (and bradesco) did.
happy hollidays.
