I was sipping my coffee and doomscrolling Linkedin like the jaded adult woman I’ve become, when I stumbled on something that left a bitter taste in my mouth (and it was not poison i swear). There it was: unsolicited, arrogant, ego-fueled feedback. Again.

The post itself was simple. Just someone sharing a project — a technical workaround, an open source tool. It was rough around the edges, might need some polish. But it worked. And it had purpose. A gift for other linux nerds to enjoy, <s>even as the rest of the tech world pretends they don’t exist</s>.

And then, there it was. One of the most “liked” (unironically) comments. Arrogant. Passive agressive as it can be. Phrased like a executioner’s order. With all the subtlety of sh*ng after a good bath.

Look, I know we need feedback. We need critique, thats how we grow. But we also need compassion. Because without it, you’re not helping, you’re projecting. You can’t handle seeing joy, freedom, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7o" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The power of Vulnerability - Brené Brown">vulnerability</a> without trying to crush it.

So let me say this clearly: If you don’t know how to give proper advice, please abstain yourself. That’s not “emotional weakness.” That’s communication literacy — and guess what? That kind of literacy makes better software. Better communities. *Better people*.

## When I was new

I had this fragile, half-broken side project. The kind of thing you pray works on at least one browser. But I was more obsessed with making things than making them right. That’s when someone smarter — some actual wobiwan-kenobis — kindly showed me how it’s done. Like, properly done.

To this day, I still ask them things. And they still teach. But here’s the wild part: they never mock me. No condescension. No smirking over my buggy code. They sat with me. They ask questions. They try to figure out what weird mysteries were rattling around in my head.

They invited themselves into my thought process — not to judge, but to understand. And once they understood, they shared their thoughts, gently. Respectfully. Meaningfully.

That’s how I’ve kept growing. Not because they forced it. But because they made it feel natural. Unintentionally, they made me want to be like them.

And that’s real feedback. It’s mentorship. The thing real people crave when they start something new. The piece of advice you can carry on throght your hole life. That’s what makes them better.

## So what doesn’t?

Turning feedback into a stage for your ego. Being combative insteed of helpfull. Dressing up your bitterness as “technical accuracy.” Weaponizing tone and calling it “just being honest.” No, it’s not "just honesty." It’s laziness. And it’s selfish.

And no — it’s not just me being emotional. I did the reading. Most of the comments were helpful, neutral, or kind. But the ones that sting? Oh, they got the front page. They take up more space in your chest. You know this and everyone does.

Being right is not a license to be an asshole. You don’t know what someone’s going through when they post a project. You don’t know how much time he dedicated to that. You don’t know if they struggled before hitting publish. You don’t know if they’ve been rejected that week. Or every week. <s>like me</s>

What you **do** know is what you choose to say. And how you say it. Of course you can’t control how someone feels about it. But you can control whether you speak with empathy or condescension. You can help them grow or make them shrink.

It’s not about being perfect. I’m not. But I try. I try to be the kind of person I needed when I was building with sticks and stones <s>I’m old</s>. I try to not make it harder for everyone else.

## The end

That’s it? Hell no! You know the guy who posted that project? He replied to the smug comment like a real professional. Very polite and reserved. In the end he was thankful for the comment. He didn’t fight. But you and I both know — he saw the tone. He felt it. We all do.

If you got this far and got yourself thinking: "Is this about me?". Maybe it is. Maybe it isn’t. But if it made you pause? If it made you wonder how your words land? Then good. That means there’s something beating inside you.

Thanks for reading.
