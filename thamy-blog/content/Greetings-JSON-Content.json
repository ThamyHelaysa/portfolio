I have had experience with Vue.js (2 years) and now my focus is React, my portfolio is built with it and Styled-Components using Gatsby, some GraphQL querys, MongoDB data and deployed in Netlify. I have experience with the main testing technologies like Jest and Cypress (2 years), I love CSS mastering any language or pre-processor and also learn new things fast - that's my main goal."
