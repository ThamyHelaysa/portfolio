    "content": "... but you can call me Thamy. I'm 25 years old and front-end developer since 2018 with experience in Design (UI/UX) and currently studying UX Engineer! My focus is React and Typescript, this portfolio is built with it, Styled-Components using Gatsby, some GraphQL querys, MongoDB data and deployed in Netlify. I love CSS mastering any language or pre-processor and also learn new things fast - that's my main goal. If you need someone that understands Design and Code for a multidisciplinary team I'm the right person!"
