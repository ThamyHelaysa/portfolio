Let’s get this straight:

Im not saying that art, music or even your 3-year-old daughter’s poem aren’t theirs to be proud of. I’m saying ideas aren’t property in the way most people think they are. 

Im a dev. Every single contribution I’ve made on the internet isn’t mine anymore. And that’s okay - for me. As a dev, my drive is to have faith in common sense. That’s all.

You can - and of course i will be immensily flattered about it - give some credit over something that you think is worth noting. **But I still won’t demand it**. Why? Not because I’m the next Mother Teresa. But because I don’t claim something that doesn’t need to be claimed.

If you "steal" something from me?

Thats proof it was worth taking it.

You wouldn’t even care about something worthless. And if you do... that’s a shame for both of us. This is not a call to chaos. I’m not saying "steal everything and give nothing". I’m saying that before we assign value, rights, or price tags to a *thought*, we need to ask if it’s something beyond price.

And here?

Every word written is not mine.</br>
It’s ours. </br>
Now that you cared enough to read it, it’s yours to take. </br>

Take all of it.
Every word, every tag and snippet of code. </br>
It’s not mine anymore.

What about the time and effort i put into this? The love I poured into it? It doesn’t matter.

*No one cares.*

And for me love isn’t an emotion, **It’s effort**.

So is writing. So is coding. So is singing. So is remixing a symphony or shaping a watercolor brushstroke or crying at Toy Story because they figured out how to rip your heart out using plastic figurines and "You’ve Got a Friend in Me".

I don’t love things. </br>
I love people. </br>

The only effort worth bragging about - the only time I want to "waste" - is my love toward those who deserve it. Those who earn it. And then I caught myself thinking:

*Why do we care so much and love so much the things we put in this world?*

Yes, we should honor the people who turned nothing into something. Praise the ones who truly deserve attribution. But... does it matter?

Why does it all loop back to you? Not <sub>you</sub> 

***You***.

Are you going to get mad because some burned-out adult took your three-line poem and turned it into merch to make a profit?

I would. And not for justice. For revenge. Capitalism revenge. No one’s trying to copyright a meme for clout... until a megacorp slaps it on a bilboard and makes millions.

***They better pay me, for fuck’s sake. Even the keyboard owes me money.***

I know that felling.

Its not about the thing you made, is about this: **(Me + Idea = Identity)**.

**I** matter because **I** made it. </br>
If it matters than **I** exist. </br>
If **I** exist then **I’m** *complete*. </br>

And that is wild - mostly because who you are is just a blender of influences, instincts, and panic responses. And when someone takes that? It’s not theft of property. 

*It’s theft of self*.

It’s not about ownership anymore. 

*It’s about power*.

And here I am selling the most precious, sacred thing I have: *my time*. Not bacause I love it. But because I need to survive. Because capitalism is louder than choice (Thanks, Rockefellers). And now Im told I must also protect, monetize, litigate... What? **My thoughts**? Really? My entire life is being rented out by the hour.

That’s not ownership. </br>
That’s hollow. </br>
And honestly? I’m ashamed.

As atheist as I can be it wasn’t always like that. The majority of my life was inside a church (not literaly, but yeah... you got it). And **The** most humble man I know never sold his words. Never demanded anything but trust and faith. And still, billions of people argue over what he really meant.

The problem? You don’t understand someone by dissecting their message. You understand them by living it.

***"What Jesus has to do with this freaking copyright shit?"***.

Everything.

He showed where the real effort should go. And that’s enough. Isn’t it?

And yeah, you might be thinking: *"this is just a girl sobbing over a failed prom date"* or *"oh here we go, the old man yelling at a cloud"*.

And you are right! I’m both :)

When I started writing this, I was screaming into the void about *how ideas aren’t property* and yadda yadda yadda. And yeah I still stand by that scream, but now I hear echoes.

I hear artists, writers, devs, musicians… all holding onto their contributions, not because they think they own the idea, but because it’s how they prove they were here.

And if you made this far, I’m impressed. It all started as a provoking joke. And finished as a mediocre essay.

But I cried over it. And I post it. That’s how it works. I will continue to write. I will continue to cry. I will continue to rant and reshape my thoughts. Not because they’ll make me rich. But because they matter to me. And for a moment... they’re mine.

If they steal it. That’s the proof it mattered.
If they credit it. That’s grace.

*I was here*.

Thanks.
