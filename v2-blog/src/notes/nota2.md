why i dont have comments on my posts

because when i write this down i want a safe place to do it. im not afraid of being wrong or start a discussion. i just want to hambuly as i can present my writing and dont be ashame of it. i want a safe place to put words into matter and not care about it. because in every corner off the internet there will be someone who disagress with me. and i dont want to doubt myself when posting things. i want to safelly go outside without bringing this shit with me. live the real life, without having to prove im right. and if i think there is a subject that i need or can change my mind over, so be it. i will not carry anything to the grave.
