Absolutely loved it.

Can’t even say anything else.
It has the perfect atmosphere, the perfect characters, the perfect writer.
It’s a masterpiece — and nothing more needs to be said.

I read it mainly because of the animated movie, and I don’t regret it. As I was reading — for the first time and even after — some scenes played out in my mind, and it was wonderful.
Seeing the movie first and reading the book after is — most of the time — a regrettable experience. Most nerds agree: some books just can’t be adapted.
But this one was different.

Jim Carrey carried Scrooge wonderfully, and still gave him room to just be, without overacting. Some meanings can’t be fully translated through motion. Some words don’t have a physical presence — they have a mystic, cosmic one.
That is a limitation — but not a bad one.

Every art form has its own power.
Its own way of reaching us.

And that’s beautiful.
