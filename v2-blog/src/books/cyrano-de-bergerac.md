Oh, Cyrano.
You were truly my first love — at first sight, at first read.

I was about ten years old when my teacher asked me to read an excerpt out loud in Portuguese class. It came from one of those government-issued schoolbooks (honestly? they were pretty good). Just a question, a snippet — meant to give context for some grammar exercise.

But I read it. Of course I did. Loud and proud, for the whole class to hear that glorious play.

And it stayed with me — not because of the elevated language or the dramatic flair (though, come on, that too). But because I needed to know if Cyrano was going to have his love. I needed to see how the story ended.

I went home, glowing with joy, and begged my mom to buy me the book. She did. Of course she did. She was perfect.

Every time I reread it, I feel the same jolt.
That joy. That sharp, hilarious, poetic, impossible nose of a man.

Nostalgia? Yes, please. Give me some of that.
