Literaly. I know that in USA thats a common thing (here in Brazil home funerals and proper buriel are the most common)... cremate somone is the most evironmental green way
of saying goodbye. But even having a literal piece (actually little tiny pieces) of her right next to me,
is not like its REALLY her.

I lost my mom in 2024. Got a message from my aunt and got the news that my mom was involved in a car accident and was currently in ER AWAITING for a proper f*king bed to be properly cared for.
At that time she was living in Alagoas one of the s*tiest states around here (im not joking, look at iliteracy and violence rate and you will find Alagoas at top 1 and 5 respectively), but it didnt hit me that was a so dangerous situation.

Cutting history short, after drowing in debt and taking a long flight I could finally see her. But first, I was introduced to one of the most morbid lectures of my entire life. I couldnt reproduce one single word of it, but the feeling of dread would still linger.

And then, after 3 years, I saw what people told me it was her. 
And it wasnt.
She couldnt breath by herself.
She couldnt walk by herself.
She couldnt talk by herself.
She coulnd simply *be*.
It was empty.
The body remained. She did not.
The beautiful green eyes that once carried an undertow were denied their opening. Her essence was drained; what had been was no longer there.
