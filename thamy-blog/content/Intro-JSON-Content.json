    "item": "Experienced front-end developer -- and yet a LOT to learn -- with a passion for creating intuitive and visually appealing - somethimes even weird like this - user experiences. Skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and always looking to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. Inspired by the mysterious and unsettling world of 'The King in Yellow' - and some pink - seeking a position where I can use my skills to bring a touch of the unknown -- and common -- to the digital realm."
