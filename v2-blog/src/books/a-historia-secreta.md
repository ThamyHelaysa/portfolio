Not a dissapointing book, but dissapointing read.

Here is the thing: I liked The Secret History, but it wasn’t joyful. Before I committed to reading it, I read too many reviews. Too many takes and many people either hyping it as the dark academia masterpiece or the one that changes your life. The plot wasn’t spoiled, but the pacing, the tone, the "energy" I'd already absorbed it through secondhand opinions.

By the time I actually read it, I couldn’t feel it fully. I was waiting to be impressed, instead of just... letting it go. That was my mistake.

Lesson learned: never again.
