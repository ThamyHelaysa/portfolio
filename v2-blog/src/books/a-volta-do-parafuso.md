I got tricked. And I kinda loved it.

This was a shame read — not because it’s scandalous, but because I felt like I should’ve seen that coming.

The Turn of the Screw pulled me in like a candlelit séance: eerie, elegant, unsettling. I was in it. Loving the atmosphere, savoring the dread (kinda weird). Getting attached to these spoopy little children and their Gothic governess. All good, up until the end.

After I finished it, I started reading some reliable reviews — as always. And they all casually mentioned the unreliable narrator.
I was flabbergasted. (God, I love that word.)

For a second, I went from “Now that makes sense” to “Shame on me.”
I had read it — yet again — as a ghost story, without asking the right questions.

In my defense, I was on a ghost story hunt in 2024, and most of my reading came with that mindset. Searching for a good ghost/paranormal tale took me straight to this book.
Luckily, my expectations were — not only met — but surpassed.

Not really a shame.
More like… a precious find.
